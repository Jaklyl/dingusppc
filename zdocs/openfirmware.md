OpenFirmware is a standard to defined a firmware's interfaces. It primarily uses the Forth programming language.

When using an Old World PCI Power Mac, it gets relocated from 0xFF800000 to 0x00400000 during boot-up, then instruction and data translations are enabled.

It gets compiled to native PowerPC code during boot-up.
